# Image Processing Exercise

## Overview
This exercise is designed to familiarize you with the NumPy library and fundamental image processing techniques. The tasks covered in this exercise include:
- Loading grayscale and RGB image representations.
- Displaying figures and images.
- Transforming RGB images to and from the YIQ color space.
- Performing intensity transformations, such as histogram equalization.
- Implementing optimal quantization.

## Project Structure
- **sol1.py**: Contains the implementation of the required functions.
- **README.md**: This file provides an overview of the project, usage instructions, and other relevant details.

## Dependencies
The following Python libraries are required to run the code:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `skimage` (for color conversion)
- `imageio` (for image loading)

To install the necessary dependencies, use:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Task Breakdown
### 1. Reading an Image
Function: `read_image(filename, representation)`  
- This function reads an image and converts it into the specified grayscale (1) or RGB (2) representation.
- Returns a normalized NumPy array with values in the range [0, 1].

### 2. Displaying an Image
Function: `imdisplay(filename, representation)`  
- Displays an image in grayscale or RGB, depending on the specified representation.

### 3. RGB to YIQ Conversion
Functions:
- `rgb2yiq(imRGB)` converts an RGB image to the YIQ color space.
- `yiq2rgb(imYIQ)` converts a YIQ image back to RGB.
  
These functions use matrix multiplication to convert between color spaces, with the Y channel normalized between [0,1], and I and Q channels in the range [-1, 1].

### 4. Histogram Equalization
Function: `histogram_equalize(im_orig)`  
- Performs histogram equalization on grayscale or RGB images.
- If the image is RGB, equalization is applied only to the Y channel in the YIQ space.
- Returns a list `[im_eq, hist_orig, hist_eq]`, where `im_eq` is the equalized image, and `hist_orig` and `hist_eq` are the histograms of the original and equalized images, respectively.

### 5. Optimal Quantization
Function: `quantize(im_orig, n_quant, n_iter)`  
- Quantizes an image into `n_quant` intensity levels using an iterative process.
- The function returns a list `[im_quant, error]`, where `im_quant` is the quantized image and `error` contains the total intensity error for each iteration.

### 6. Bonus (Optional)
Function: `quantize_rgb(im_orig, n_quant)`  
- Applies optimal quantization to full-color RGB images. This function is optional and may use additional methods such as Median Cut or other clustering algorithms for color quantization.

## Toy Examples
Several toy examples are provided to test the functions, including:
- A gradient image for testing histogram equalization (`grad` image).
- Example images for quantization testing.

## Usage
1. Import the provided Python script:
   ```python
   from sol1 import *
   ```

2. Example usage of functions:
   ```python
   im = read_image('image.png', 2)
   imdisplay('image.png', 2)
   im_eq, hist_orig, hist_eq = histogram_equalize(im)
   im_quant, error = quantize(im, 4, 10)
   ```

3. To visualize errors during the quantization process:
   ```python
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   plt.plot(error)
   plt.show()
   ```

## Submission Instructions
- The code should be placed in a single file called `sol1.py` with all functions and global constants.
- This README file must be included in the submission.
- Ensure that no top-level code or global variables are used in `sol1.py`.
- Follow the specific guidelines outlined in the course submission instructions.
